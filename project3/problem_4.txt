This algorithm takes an unsorted input array which contains only 0, 1, and 2 and return the sorted array with a single traversal and not creating extra space. The idea of this algorithm is to set the index for element 0, 1, and 2 and switch element in the array if it is not in the right index. This algorithm use only one single traverse so the time complexity is O(n). Also it does not creating extra space to the space complexity is O(1).
