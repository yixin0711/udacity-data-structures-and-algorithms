This algorithm takes a int object as input and will output the floored square root without using the built-in function. It is similar to a searching algorithm which search a number from a sorted list [1:number] and return that value. We started from the middle of this array and search left side if larger than target and vice versa. This will take in average O(logn) times since in each iteration we cut the array in half. The space complexity is O(1) since we are not creating extra space in further loops.
