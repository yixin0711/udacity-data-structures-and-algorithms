This algorithm takes a list of integers as input and return a pair of two integers such that their sum is maximum. The key idea of this algorithm is that the input list is unsorted so that we need a sorting algorithm to achieve our goal. I used mergesort algorithms which will take O(n*log n) times to finish sorting. Once the sorting is done, the two integers are easy to find, taking only O(n) times. Taking only the dominant term, the whole algorithm takes O(n*log n) times. The space complexity of mergesort algorithms is O(n) since it takes 1 space to store each element in the array.
